# Nimator [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ghh8tjguwyb9wpru?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JeroenHeijmans/nimator)

A light-weight framework for creating an application to monitor your systems. You to write checks for your systems in C#, and the framework takes care of (nearly all) the rest.

You are looking at a very early version of this codebase. Even though we are dogfooding this code, please consider it as pre-alpha code at this moment.

## NuGet

Nimator is [listed on NuGet as a package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nimator/). Again, note that this is a very early version, use at your own risk.

```
Install-Package Nimator
```

The above command will get you the latest version. Please note that we will not move to SemVer until a "version 1" has crystallized, and until then any new package versions might include breaking changes.
